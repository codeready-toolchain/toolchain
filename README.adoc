This repo is for controllers, libs, scripts, make files, etc to be shared between host and member operators.

== Build

Requires Go version 1.13 - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules]. You may need to `export GO111MODULE=on` to turn modules support "on".

== Setting Up and Connecting Host and Member Clusters

In a new terminal, execute the following commands
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/codeready-toolchain/host-operator
$ minishift start --profile host
$ make login-as-admin 
$ make create-namespace 
$ make deploy-rbac
$ make deploy-crd
```

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/codeready-toolchain/member-operator
$ minishift start --profile member
$ make login-as-admin 
$ make create-namespace 
$ make deploy-rbac
$ make deploy-crd
$ make add-member-to-host
$ make add-host-to-member
$ make build
$ make vendor
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=toolchain-member-operator
$ operator-sdk up local --namespace=toolchain-member-operator --verbose
```

Now that we are setup, we can add resources and watch the logs on the member-operator! To do so, open a new terminal and run the following commands
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/codeready-toolchain/host-operator
$ minishift profile set host
$ make use-namespace
$ oc apply -f '/path/to/masteruserrecord.yaml'
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/codeready-toolchain/member-operator
$ minishift profile set member
$ make use-namespace
$ oc apply -f '/path/to/useraccount.yaml'
```

**Example masteruserrecord.yaml:**

_Note:_ The `targetCluster` field must contain the correct member cluster name.
```
apiVersion: toolchain.dev.openshift.com/v1alpha1
kind: MasterUserRecord
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  disabled: false
  deprovisioned: false
  userID: 86505192-a386-11e9-ad56-525400ad2b23
  userAccounts:
  - targetCluster: member-192-168-42-61-8443
    syncIndex: 86505a
    spec:

        - type: code
          revision: abcdef
        - type: stage
          revision: abcdef
```

**Example useraccount.yaml:**
```

      revision: abcdef
    - type: stage
      revision: abcdef
```

== Configuring developers.redhat.com Authentication in OpenShift 4 Cluster

Create a secret with Identity Provider credentials:
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/idp_secret.yaml
```
Create an Identity Provider:
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/idp.yaml
```

== Creating User

Create a user, identity and user identity mapping:
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/user.yaml
```

== Scripts

=== add-cluster.sh

The CodeReady Toolchain architecture contains two types of clusters `host` and `member`.
To connect these two clusters together it is necessary to run a script link:scripts/add-cluster.sh[] that takes multiple flags like, `--type`, `--member-ns`, `--host-ns`, `--single-cluster`. However you can see all these options by using `./scripts/add-cluster.sh -h`

==== host and member clusters using host and member profiles on minishift
Make sure that you have started minishift as different profiles. You can use following commands for it.

* `minishift start --profile host`
* `minishift start --profile member`

Once you have minishift running with above profiles, you can `./add-clusters.sh` script with required flags.

Assumption: This script assumes that you have host and member operators running on host and member clusters(in our case clusters are different profiles)
in respective namespace with all requires resources like Service Account, (Cluster)Role, (Cluste)RoleBinding, Custom Resource Definition.

*Scenario 1: Add Member to Host*

```bash
./scripts/add-cluster.sh -t member
```
or

```bash
make add-member-to-host
```

**Steps included:**

    . goes to the cluster with `member` profile i.e. member cluster
    . takes a secret of the SA (from the `member`)
    . takes API endpoint and cluster name of the `member` cluster from Kube config
    . goes to `host` profile
    . takes cluster name of the `host` cluster from Kube config
    . creates a secret with the SA token taken from the `member`
    . creates `KubeFedCluster` CR representing the added `member`

Note: We have make target available for this i.e. `make add-member-to-host` in member-operator, host-operator repository

*Scenario 2: Add Host to Member*
```bash
./scripts/add-cluster.sh -t host
```
or

```bash
make add-host-to-member
```

**Steps included:**

    . goes to the cluster with `host` profile i.e. host cluster
    . takes a secret of the SA (from the `host`)
    . takes API endpoint and cluster name of the `host` cluster from Kube config
    . goes to `member` profile
    . takes cluster name of the `member` cluster from Kube config
    . creates a secret with the SA token taken from the `host`
    . creates `KubeFedCluster` CR representing the added `host`

Note: We have make target available for this i.e. `make add-host-to-member` member-operator, host-operator repository

==== Using a single cluster for both operators host and member
Make sure that you have started minishift. You can use following commands for it.

* `minishift start`

Once you have minishift or any openshift cluster running and logged in as admin, you can run `./scripts/add-clusters.sh` script with required flags.

Assumption: This script assumes that you have host and member operators running on minishift or any other Openshift cluster
in respective namespace with all requires resources like Service Account, (Cluster)Role, (Cluster)RoleBinding, Custom Resource Definition.
*Scenario 1: Add Member to Host*

```bash
./scripts/add-cluster.sh -t member -s
```

**Steps included:**

    . takes a secret of the SA (from the `toolchain-member-operator` namespace)
    . takes API endpoint and cluster name of the `member` cluster from Kube config
    . takes cluster name of the `host` cluster from Kube config
    . creates a secret in `toolchain-host-operator` namespace with the SA token taken from the `toolchain-member-operator` ns
    . creates `KubeFedCluster` in `toolchain-host-operator` namespace CR representing the added `member`

*Scenario 2: Add Host to Member*
```bash
./scripts/add-cluster.sh -t host -s
```

**Steps included:**

    . takes a secret of the SA (from the `toolchain-host-operator`)
    . takes API endpoint and cluster name of the `host` cluster from Kube config
    . takes cluster name of the `member` cluster from Kube config
    . creates a secret in `toolchain-member-operator` namespace with the SA token taken from the `toolchain-host-operator` ns
    . creates `KubeFedCluster` in `toolchain-member-operator` namespace CR representing the added `host`

==== overwriting default namespaces for member-operator and host-operator

If you are running `member-operator` and `host-operator` in different namespaces other than default (i.e. not in `toolchain-member-operator` or `toolchain-host-operator`), you can do it passing `-mn or -hs` flags

```bash
./scripts/add-cluster.sh --type host --member-ns member-operator-0xdf4 --host-ns host-operator-hj6d7 --single-cluster
```

While overwriting default namespaces, please do remember to provide member and host namespace. If you are trying to overwrite with single namespace, it's not supported at this point.
